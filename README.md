# Godot 4.2 Multiplayer Template
A template created as a base for making a multiplayer game in Godot 4.2.

This is _heavily_ based off [documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html), but with more comments and additions.

My/Godot's implimentation is for `"localhost"` connections, and is not designed for a dedicated server. It could be modified, as explained in more detail [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_dedicated_servers.html#doc-exporting-for-dedicated-servers).

It is currently _just_ an example lobby where players can join and disconnect with their own display names. There is no example of gameplay yet!
